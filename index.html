                <h1>Firstly, all about my feelings.</h1>
                <p>I've been thinking a lot about this for the past few days. I don't know if you noticed, but after the day you shouted at me and I got mad (actually I was just hurt, only because it was you), I didn't interact with you a lot for a few days. When I was with the group, I tried to talk normally and act normal, but when I was alone, I didn't try to approach you in any way, like going to college together or something. This was because my mind was all jumbled up with thoughts. I thought of ending my crush, and I tried, but I can't easily let go of someone once I start to actually like them. </p>

                <h1>Firstly, all about my feelings (part-2).</h1>
                <p>IOne part of me was selfish and wanted to date immediately. But another part within me was telling me to let it all go,
                because right now, all I have is my parents' money, which I don't want to use, but again, I don't have any income
                myself. And for me, I don't plan to just date anyone casually ever. If I want to date someone, I would really like and
                care for them. And because of that, I want to provide them as much as I can. So, I didn't want to be selfish, but I also
                wanted to date you, so my mind was in a pretty complicated situation.</p>

                <p>Then I finally came up with a solution. I don't think you have any kind of romantic feelings for me right now, so I will officially start chasing you from now 游때.</p>
                <p>I don't know how to express my feelings, and so I don't think I have ever expressed my feelings for you properly. So this time, I will try to, and by the time I have an income of my own, I will ask you out again 游논. And I wish that at time I will be able to properly provide you and make you as happy as I can 游때.</p>
